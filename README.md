# Emerging-Technologies-Jupyter
This repository contains the solutions to the third problem sheet on Jupyter, numpy, and pyplot given as part of my fourth year emerging technologies module in college. The problems below use the iris data set. All solutions are contained in a single Jupyter notebook file. Note that the solutions to these problems were written in Python 3.5.

# Problems to solve

## 1. Get and load the data
Search online for Fisherâ€™s iris data set, find a copy of the data, download it and save it to your repository. If it is not in CSV format, use whatever means (Excel, notepad++, visual studio code, python) to convert it to CSV and save the CSV version to your repository also. Open your Jupyter notebook for this problem sheet, creating a new one if needed, and load the CSV file into a numpy array.

**Solution:** Downloaded the iris data set from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data) to a file called `iris.csv` in the data folder.

## 2 Write a note about the data set
In a markdown cell at the start of your notebook, write a short description of the iris data set, complete with references.

**Solution:** A description of the iris data set can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.names).
